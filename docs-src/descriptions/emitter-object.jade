h2#emitter-object Emitter object

p.
  Emitter object is an object, that has four methods for emitting events.
  It is used in several places in Kefir as a proxy to emit events to some observable.

p.
  The methods names describe themself pretty clearly:

ul
  li #[tt emitter.emit(value)] accepts one argument (any value)
  li #[tt emitter.error(error)] accepts one argument (any value)
  li #[tt emitter.end()] accepts no arguments
  li #[tt emitter.emitEvent(event)] accepts one agrument (event object with same format as in #[a(href='#on-any') onAny] method). Note that the #[tt current] property of #[b event object] are ignored and automatically set to appropriate value for result event.

pre
  :escapehtml
    emitter.emit(123);
    emitter.error('Oh, snap!');
    emitter.end();
div

p.
  Do not confuse #[b emitter object] with <a href="#emitter">emitter stream</a>.
  They both have similar methods,
  but #[b emitter object] isn't actually a stream,
  it has no stream methods or functionality.
  Emitter object has only four methods, that's it.

p.
  All #[b emitter object] methods are bound to its context,
  and can be passed safely as callbacks without binding:

pre
  :escapehtml
    // instead of this
    $('.foo').on('click', emitter.emit.bind(emitter));

    // you can do just this
    $('.foo').on('click', emitter.emit);
div
